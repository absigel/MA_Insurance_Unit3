Unit 3 Repository for ENGL105
This is a repository containing instructional materials and sample datasets for Professor Gotzler's sections of ENGL105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

The repository contains 3 Python notebooks:
1. module on basic topics in coding with Python3
2. module on getting started with the Pandas package
3. secondary module on using the Pandas package for data analysis

These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the [Research Hub](https://library.unc.edu/data/) of UNC's Davis Library.
