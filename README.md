# Massachusetts Insurance Data

This repository includes a notebook with information on using Python, Pandas, and compiling data. It also includes compiled data and visualizations regarding insurance in Massachusetts.  

- The main County Health Data set was downloaded as a CSV file from Professor Gotzler's ENGL105 Canvas site. The Massachusetts Insurance Subset was compiled in Python following the steps layed out in the notebook. 
- This data is for those interested in insurance in Massachusetts. 
- This repository is beneficial for anyone replicating the compiling of data from the County Health Data set using Python. 
- The data itself can be useful in research regarding the number of people in Massachusetts who are uninsured and the amount people pay for insurance by county. This information could be incredibly important for insurance companies attempting to insure more people across Massachusetts counties. Understanding how many people are insured and how much people pay for insurance by county can be useful in targeting certain counties.

The following bar graph shows the differences between the numbers of uninsured adults versus children in each Massachusetts County. Typically, there is a positive correlation between the two variables. It is also clear which counties have greater numbers of insured adults and children. Although there are exceptions, in most counties when more adults are uninsured there are more children who are uninsured as well.
