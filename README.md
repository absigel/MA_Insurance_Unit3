- This repository is beneficial for anyone replicating the compiling of data from the County Health Data set using Python. 
- The data itself can be useful in research regaurding the amount of people in Masschusetts who are uninsured and the amount people pay for insurance by county. This information could be incredibly important for insurance companies attempting to insure more people across Massachusetts counties. 

The following bar graph shows the differences between the numbers of uninsured adults versus children in each Massachusetts County. Typically, there is a positive correlation between the two variables. It is also clear which counties have greater numbers of insured adults and children. Although there are exceptions, in most counties when more adults are uninsured there are more children who are uninsured as well.
